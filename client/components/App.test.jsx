    // We can add a simple check to ensure something rendered,
    // for example, the main div or waiting for the splash screen logic to kick in.
    // However, the primary goal here is to catch the `id.replace` error if it happens
    // during the initial render sequence.
    
    // Example: Check for the main container div if App always renders one.
    // const mainDiv = container.querySelector('.bg-cyber-dark');
    // expect(mainDiv).toBeInTheDocument();
    // The above line would need `container` from `render`.

    // For now, just rendering is the test. If it throws, the test fails.
    // If it doesn't throw, this specific test passes.
    // We are trying to isolate when the "id.replace" error happens.
